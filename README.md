We are going to use ABN_NYC.csv dataset from kaggle.com with below link. 
https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data/data

Dataset has other columns and you need to examine price column and do following. 
(1) Plot histogram to see data distribution.
(2) Remove outliers using percentile technique. Use [0.001, 0.999] for lower and upper bound percentiles
 (3)  After removing outliers in step 2, you get a new dataframe. 
(4) You can plot histogram for new dataframe that is generated after step (3). Also plot bell curve on same histogram.
 Your goal is to come up with new dataframe that doesn't have the outliers present in it.
